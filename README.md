# Android application: NameOfTheApplication (didn't find one at the moment)
## Description:
    What I want to do for the android project is an application that could make playlist out of a sentence. The sentence will be written by the user in a place dedicated to it. Then it will search in an API of music a list of musics that correspond to the sentence.
    
    Example: You search for "I love pina colada" and it will make a deezer/youtube/spotify (I don't know yet) playlist with I love from Joyner Lucas and pina colada from Yung Pinch
    
## Motivation
    I really want to make this application because it's something I've been thinking about for a long time now. And I think music can make people closer, more intimate. Plus, I really think it can be funny to share some messages through music in your own way. If you miss someone you can tell him through music you like, through this application you can also discover new artist.
